# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project allows you to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the area, location, number of bedrooms, and whether it is a resale or a new property. This project aims to predict the price of houses in major metropolitan cities of India (Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad) with an accuracy of 80% using a machine learning model. The model used is a random forest regressor.
